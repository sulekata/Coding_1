This folder contains the codes which were used to perform the analysis, namely:
* clean_data.R: cleans and transforms the [raw data file](https://github.com/sulekata/Coding_1/tree/master/Term_Project/data/raw) so that it becomes suitable for the analysis.
* function_sum_stat.R: a function which creates summary statistics for the input data and can originally be found [here](https://github.com/CEU-Economics-and-Business/ECBS-5208-Coding-1-Business-Analytics/blob/master/Class_10/codes/sum_stat_f.R).
* analysis_report_html.Rmd: performs the entire analysis on the [clean data files](https://github.com/sulekata/Coding_1/tree/master/Term_Project/data/clean) and generates a [report](https://github.com/sulekata/Coding_1/blob/master/Term_Project/docs/report_html.html) in html format.
* analysis_report_pdf.Rmd: performs the entire analysis on the [clean data files](https://github.com/sulekata/Coding_1/tree/master/Term_Project/data/clean) and generates a [report](https://github.com/sulekata/Coding_1/blob/master/Term_Project/docs/report_pdf.pdf) in pdf format.
